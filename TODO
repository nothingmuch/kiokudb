=== Small ===

* Doc work
    * Doc audit
        * make a doc todo list
        * especially for backend authors and KiokuDB::Role::*
    * More command line tool docs
        * backup, recovery, etc
    * FAQ and index
        * where to find information, for instance to do proper backup
        * procedures for the BDB backend you need to read BerkeleyDB::Manager
    * Start writing a cookbook

* more roles for KiokuX::User
    * non ID based
        * allow username to != object ID, so that users can be renamed
    * email address handling
    * role based access control
        * "real" runtime roles, or a list of RBAC role names
        * integrate with Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles
    * high level password change/reset role using auth token objects
        * inserts an object pointing to the user, that can reset the password for the user
        * the ID of the token is secret, and can be emailed to the user
        * an action that then loads the object, resets the password, and
          then deletes the auth token object

* symbolic aliases
    * KiokuDB::Entry::Alias or somesuch
    * used to set additional high level IDs for objects, after they are
      already in the database
    * Linker api to handle these on load
    * on insert they are just special objects
    * simple api in KiokuDB.pm to manage aliases (create, delete, etc).

* configuration file support
    * need to be able to specify:
        * regular options
        * typemaps
        * extra libs to load
    * shouldn't be hard with MooseX::YAML
    * KiokuDB->connect("/path/to/my_db.yml");
    * KiokuDB->connect("/path/to/dir"); # reads /path/to/dir/kiokudb.yml
    * subdirectories for standard directory layout:
        * data/ - actual storage
        * lib/ - possibly used for typemap defs, etc

* RPC backend
    * simple proxying of backend methods and a KiokuDB::Backend::Remote client
    * try for a nonblocking api, be able to plug in to a standalone blocking
      daemon, a larger setup, or into anyevent/POE without horrible performance
    * we'll need a preforking daemon for the backend performance
      (Concurrency::POSIX can make this automatic), but ideally we can have a
      nonblocking api role for most backends (see event based api below)
    * see also RPC server below

* Cache::Bounded for immutable objects
    * simple hack to keep them live longer than normal

* simple profiling hooks
    * under some debug mode collect timing info for linker & collapser
    * display this info in Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB's debug output

=== Medium ===

* root set membership delegated to typemap
    * will allow Root and NonRoot roles in MOP typemap entry
    * top level values for ->store and ->insert still set default
    * ->set_root always authoritative

* Schema versioning
    * store version in entries
    * add an upgrade hook to typemap entries
        * if $Class::VERSION ne $entry->class_version then the upgrade hook is fired
        * the upgrade hook is responsible for creating a new entry
        * convenience api:
            * hash of callbacks:
                {
                    $version => $per_version_hook
                    $version => $aliased_to_version, # treat objects
                        # with version $version like they are objects
                        # of version $aliased_to_version
                },
            * if a version is missing that is an error
    * add a schema upgrade command line tool
        * scans the DB for entries with versions that != current, and loads and
          then updates those objects

* $dir->refresh($object), $dir->deep_refresh($object)
    * add refreshing method to typemap entries
    * reload entry from the backend
    * if entry data != live entry data, fire the typemap entry method
    * if deep, recurse
    * entry definitions:
        * MOP entry involves just reassigning values
        * Naive reassigns %$obj = ( @new_fields );
        * Callback entry is a callback
        * Storable - re-fire STORABLE_thaw on the live object?
        * Passthrough - dies
        * Set
            * if shallow downgrade to Deferred and reload IDs assign new member IDs if shallow, downgrade to Deferred
            * if deep upgrade to Loaded and refresh members

* KiokuDB::Server
    * server side linkage
    * return transitive closure of entries to improve latency
    * server side filtering
    * server side transactions on behalf of clients

* fix the set_root work on immutable/CAS objects bug (the 'root' flag is not
  written because the object is skipped)

* caching support
    * authoritative cache support
        * entry caching for slower backends
    * non authoritative cache
        * various degrees of correctness (simpledb like "gurantees" ;-)

* data sharding
    * map classes of UIDs to different backends or different tables in a
      backend
    * string based i guess, though we could also decorate the entry object with
      metadata about where it should go in addition
    * uses:
        * transient data storage (e.g. web sessions)
        * grouping of data for scanning purposes
        * grouping of data for configuration purposes (e.g. different search
          columns in DBI, content id objects in CAS storage)
    * actual backend work is more involved but doing the high level is pretty easy

* XS acceleration
    * LiveObjects
        * implement custom uvar magic hash instead of Scope::Guard all over
            * should provide significant speed & memory consumption
              improvements
    * Linker
        * inflate_data is actually really ugly in Perl, could be
          smaller/faster/cleaner in XS due to lack of of code duplication
    * Data::Visitor
        * generic acceleration for Data::Visitor, ask nothingmuch for details
        * affects:
            * Collapser
            * $entry->references
            * jspon? not anymore but could convert back

* Set::Object and hash key sharding
    * each hash entry or set member is an entry/row in a table (BDB and DBI)
      hash).
    * This allows finer grained commits (e.g. insertion to a set from two
      competing transactions does not cause a failed transaction) under
      MULTIVERSION for BDB.
    * this also allows to run queries that test for set membership (but we
      still can't write those queries)
    * sharding thsould be implemented as a base role that backends can
      implement

* CodeRefs serialization
    * if the subname of the CV is valid and it has a ->FILE then maybe store as
      a symbolic ref instead (requiring the file to load it)?

* Attribute meta traits
    * each of these is relatively small and self contained
    * lazy build attributes (for cached values)
        * build on store
        * keep when storing but dont build on store
            * make sure update() on immutable objects works for this, too
        * do not serialize
    * ID attribute
        * don't store ID twice, once as a field and once in the entry (skip the
          field)
        * better than KiokuDB::Role::ID
    * Digest Part
        * resistent to subclassing/role composition
            * however, order must be stable, sort get_all_attributes
                * order by sort index is provided
                * rest of attributes sorted:
                    * required attributes before non required ones
                    * sub sort by name
                * required attributes first, ordered by sort index or name if no sort index is provided
    * Build on store meta trait

=== Large ===

* RDF backend
    * generate triples
        * predicates as FQ attr names names
        * predicates as short attr names
        * predicates as UUIDs?
        * disable simple ref collapsing by default?
    * SPARQL matching for simple search

* event based api
    * linker is almost ready to integrate event based linking
    * if backend returns a cond var for get() then we can return a cond var for
      the whole graph. start with an api for it, and slowly implement actual
      async behavior using a backend role
    * AnyEvent::BDB, Files and CouchDB backends could benefit
    * skeptical about performance of DBI with forking
    * does the live object scope still make sense? probably, but it's much
      easier to leak it. the event oriented wrapper should keep live object
      scopes for the user at least for the duration of a callback, in
      additional to the user tracking to minimize confusion. $lookup->recv
      could return the scope into which the objects were loaded, along with the
      results

* threading
    * what happens with a shared KiokuDB directory? i don't think that's a good
      idea... better that each thread has its own copy? how can we guarantee
      recursive thread sharing of passthrough/callback objects?
    * investigate by writing tests and then fixing as appropriate

* persistent metaclass
    * store Moose class definition in code by creating metaclasses which when
      loaded redefine the class in memory
        * might need to subclass Moose::Meta::Class to take care of stored code
    * this allows us to create a smalltalk inspired environment

* Garbage collection
    * Online garbage collection schemes
        * entries can already enumerate their out links
        * several possibilities:
            * refcounting
                * on store diff $entry->references with
                  $entry->prev->references and update counts
            * rel index table is another
                * all references are cross referenced in a table that can be also
                  used to list backrefs. In SQL this table can have delete triggers
                  i guess (ask mugwump), in BDB this would be manual.
            * incremental scheme
                * parrot's tricolor garbage collection alrogithm is interesting
                    * the data could be partly maintained during store/delete
                      operations, with a partial sweep performed every time some
                      statistic is tipped
                * generational GC could make sense here, due to the persistence
                  of the data
    * Offline schemes
        * currently we do a full sweep in a single transaction
            * this is potentially like a global lock, except with the
              possibility of deadlocking, it would be nice to have an
              incremental scheme with small transactions
        * mark & sweep
            * tri-color using some auxillary table
            * smaller transactions to update the aux table
            * online updating of the aux table interleaved
            * final txn reads the aux table, and deletes in a single txn
            * allows the sweep to be performed incrementally without locking
              everything
        * collection of clusters of data: http://www-sor.inria.fr/publi/GC-PERS-DSM_POS94.html
