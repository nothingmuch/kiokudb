* configuration file
    * need to be able to specify:
        * regular options
        * typemaps
        * extra libs to load
        * GIN extractors

* Backends:
    * BDB/DBI
        * Set::Object/Hash sharding (each key/member is an entry in the BDB
          hash). This allows finer grained commits (e.g. insertion to a set
          simultaneously will not cause a failed transaction). Will BDB even
          allow transactions to do that? probably with MULTIVERSION, because
          the read won't block
    * RDF
        * generate triples
            * predicates as FQ attr names names
            * predicates as short attr names
            * predicates as UUIDs?
            * no collapsing by default
        * SPARQL matching with simple search

* concurrency test fixture for backends
    * forks
    * threads

* event based
    * linker is almost ready to integrate event based linking
    * if backend returns a cond var for get() then we can return a cond var for
      the whole graph. start with an api for it, and slowly implement actual
      async behavior using a backend role
    * AnyEvent::BDB, Files and CouchDB backends could benefit
    * skeptical about performance of DBI with forking
    * does the live object scope still make sense? probably, but it's much
      easier to leak it. the event oriented wrapper should keep live object
      scopes for the user at least for the duration of a callback, in
      additional to the user tracking to minimize confusion. $lookup->recv
      could return the scope into which the objects were loaded, along with the
      results

* threading
    * what happens with a shared KiokuDB directory? i don't think that's a good
      idea... better that each thread has its own copy? how can we guarantee
      recursive thread sharing of passthrough/callback objects?

* typemap
    * DB resident metaclass? like a smalltalk image
	* class version upgrade path as part of class field

* tools
    * generic garbage collector? 'root' isn't really that accurate.. think of a better way

* query
