* Backends:

        * BDB
        * Dir
            * Flat
            * Trie
    * DBI
        * props + blob column with Serialize role
    * SQLite
        * with dynamic alter table statements?
        * audrey style indexing?
    * BDB
        * Set::Object/Hash sharding
        * tight GIN integration
        * txn_do, setup, associate etc from GIN in a separate BDB wrapper
    * RDF
        * generate triples
            * predicates as FQ attr names names
            * predicates as short attr names
            * predicates as UUIDs?

        * SPARQL matching with simple search
    * Backend::TXN
    * Backend::Locking

* caching support
    * entries only? How else do we guarantee no weak ref breakage?
    * maybe cache full scopes up to a certain limit?
        * defer destruction of orphanned scopes as long as object count is
          under a bound?

* typemap
    * default types
    * runtime role support
        * json in class field?
        * Reference in class field?
            * fully DB resident metaclass?

* lazy loading:
    * Set::Object
        * insert without loading members
        * remove without loading members
        * exists without loading members (object already loaded)
        * set operations produce ID sets
    * array
        * tie and lazy fetch
    * thunk
        * what are the degenerate cases?
        * how to break circular dependencies?

* tools
    * consistency checker
    * generic garbage collector
    * backup/restore
        * yaml output
        * storable output
        * backend to backend
