0.16
    - Lots of docs
    - Fix KiokuDB::Reference's Storable hook limitation using a simple
      workaround. Not a real fix yet.
    - Remove unnecessary code from the UUID generation roles.
    - In KiokuDB::Cmd::OutputHandle, don't clobber the file before the command
      has actually run (remove EarlyBuild attr)

0.15
    - Last version was accidentally released off a problematic branch,
      rereleasing without that change

0.14
    - skip incremental JSON parsing tests if JSON::XS is missing
    - load IO::Handle to attempt to work around some weird test failures

0.13
    - t/serializer.t was causing bogus failures by not skipping if YAML::XS is
      unavailable
    - Cleanup of ( is => 'rw' ) bits in KiokuDB::Entry that should have really
      had private writers instead
    - Introduce partial handling of anonymous classes created due to runtime
      application of roles ( My::Role->meta->apply($instance) )

0.12
    - Remove a use Devel::PartialDump that accidentally got committed

0.11
    - Fetching now queues items so that the backend's get() method is called
      fewer times, with more IDs each time. This significantly increases the
      performance of high latency backends, such as DBI or CouchDB.
    - fill in SimpleSearch stub fixture
    - Various fixes for Binary fixture
    - Make the various fields of the JSPON format customizable
    - Serialization is now pluggable using the Delegate serialization role

0.10
    - Load classes in the typemap resolution code, so that objects whose
      classes aren't necessarily loaded at compile time can still be inflated.
    - add 'import_yaml' to KiokuDB::Util
    - Refactor parts of the JSPON file backend into a JSON serialization role
    - Don't load thunks when updating partially loaded objects
    - No longer dies if txn_do is used but the backend doesn't supports it
      (implicit noop)
    - Add a new role and test for nested transaction supporting backends
      (partial rollback)

0.09
    - Remove KiokuDB::Resolver, moving ID assignment functionality into the
      collapser and the typemap
    - Fix bogus failures on 5.8 due to weird leaks (perl bug affecting test suite)

0.08
    - Fix a breakage in inflating passthrough intrinsic objects created with
      older versions of KiokuDB
    - Refactor command line tools to use App::Cmd
    - Add KiokuDB::LinkChecker and a FSCK command

0.07
    - Rename backend roles to KiokuDB::Backend::Role::Foo (omega)
    - Change entry packing format in Storable to something less idiotic

0.06
    - Use epoch, not ISO 8601 dates in JSPON map by default to avoid issues
      with DateTime::Format::ISO8601 dependency in testing. Will support both in the future
    - Fix tied support for JSPON

0.05
    - Add default typemaps for JSON and Storable serialization

0.04
    - Fix ->clear in KiokuDB::GIN

0.03
    - Lots of new docs
    - Smaller set of dependencies
        - Many deps are now optional (skips tests)
        - Some dependencies weren't necessary
    - Hand written code instead of MooseX::AttributeHelpers in live objects
    - Fixed an random test failure in live_objects.t that accidentally depended
      on address space ordering

0.02
    - Lazy meta trait for attributes
    - DoNotSerialize meta trait is now respected
    - Documentation updates
    - Removes several unrelated files form the dist
    - NoGetopt related fixes for command line tools
    - Remove JSPON backend files
    - Dependency fixes
    - KiokuDB::Role::ID

0.01
    - Initial Release
