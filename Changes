      not actually in storage.
    - Don't call $backend->exists with no arguments in FSCK
    - various API methods now just return; when invoked with no arguments,
      instead of potentially erroring at the backend level

0.35
    - bump dependency version for MooseX::YAML to prevent bad interaction with
      MooseX::Blessed::Reconstruct
    - add insert_nonroot and store_nonroot methods

0.34
    - fix an incorrect conversion to Try::Tiny (Dylan)
    - remove ciruclar role definition that causes does_role to inf loop
    - laxen the exception matching regex for missing .pm files in @INC to
      address CPAN testers reports with a different formatting for that error

0.33

    - Correct indexing tutorial example (ask)
    - Use done_testing() instead of no_plan (dandv)
    - Fix behavior of KiokuDB::Lazy attributes with a trigger (a Moose change

    - Support for serializing closures

0.27

    - Change dep versions of IO and Tie::RefHash::Weak (they were wrong under
      5.8) (Thanks to Otto Hirr)
    - KiokuDB::Lazy did not have any effect unless the value was a first class
      objects. Now it works for all refs (e.g. arrays of objects)

    - add Collapser::Buffer, which replaces the various temp attrs. Changes

      inserted when one is already live.
    - Various doc improvements

    - Add TXN::Memory role to provide memory bufferred transactions to backends only
      supporting atomicity guarantees (e.g. CouchDB)

0.20

    - Added KiokuDB::TypeMap::Entry::StorableHook, which allows reusing of
      existing STORABLE_freeze hooks
    - Fixed handling of 'root' flag (was not being properly preserved)
    - Added 'is_root', 'set_root', 'unset_root'
    - Added a 'deep_update' method

      intrinsically

    - Test suite cleanups
    - Added ID enumeration to Scan role
    - Added 'allow_classes', 'allow_bases' and 'allow_class_builders' options
      to KiokuDB allowing for easy typemap creation.

0.19
    - Introduce KiokuDB::Stream::Objects, a Data::Stream::Bulk for objects that
      automatically creates a new scope for each block. This makes it much
      harder to leak when iterating through C<all_objects>.

0.18
    - Fix KiokUDB->connect("foo", @args) when the dsn string has no parameters
      (@args were being ignored)
    - Add a fixture to test that overwriting an entry is not allowed.

0.17
    - More docs
    - remove KiokuDB::Backend::Null which was historically used for testing but
      is long since useless.
    - remove deprecated command line tools
    - provide a 'txn_do' method in Role::TXN for backends which only implement
      txn_begin, txn_rollback and txn_commit
    - correct plan for t/uuid.t when a module is missing

0.16
    - Lots of docs
    - Fix KiokuDB::Reference's Storable hook limitation using a simple
      workaround. Not a real fix yet.
    - Remove unnecessary code from the UUID generation roles.
    - In KiokuDB::Cmd::OutputHandle, don't clobber the file before the command
      has actually run (remove EarlyBuild attr)

0.15
    - Last version was accidentally released off a problematic branch,
      rereleasing without that change

0.14
    - skip incremental JSON parsing tests if JSON::XS is missing
    - load IO::Handle to attempt to work around some weird test failures

0.13
    - t/serializer.t was causing bogus failures by not skipping if YAML::XS is
      unavailable
    - Cleanup of ( is => 'rw' ) bits in KiokuDB::Entry that should have really
      had private writers instead
    - Introduce partial handling of anonymous classes created due to runtime
      application of roles ( My::Role->meta->apply($instance) )

0.12
    - Remove a use Devel::PartialDump that accidentally got committed

0.11
    - Fetching now queues items so that the backend's get() method is called
      fewer times, with more IDs each time. This significantly increases the
      performance of high latency backends, such as DBI or CouchDB.
    - fill in SimpleSearch stub fixture
    - Various fixes for Binary fixture
    - Make the various fields of the JSPON format customizable
    - Serialization is now pluggable using the Delegate serialization role

0.10
    - Load classes in the typemap resolution code, so that objects whose
      classes aren't necessarily loaded at compile time can still be inflated.
    - add 'import_yaml' to KiokuDB::Util
    - Refactor parts of the JSPON file backend into a JSON serialization role
    - Don't load thunks when updating partially loaded objects
    - No longer dies if txn_do is used but the backend doesn't supports it
      (implicit noop)
    - Add a new role and test for nested transaction supporting backends
      (partial rollback)

0.09
    - Remove KiokuDB::Resolver, moving ID assignment functionality into the
      collapser and the typemap
    - Fix bogus failures on 5.8 due to weird leaks (perl bug affecting test suite)

0.08
    - Fix a breakage in inflating passthrough intrinsic objects created with
      older versions of KiokuDB
    - Refactor command line tools to use App::Cmd
    - Add KiokuDB::LinkChecker and a FSCK command

0.07
    - Rename backend roles to KiokuDB::Backend::Role::Foo (omega)
    - Change entry packing format in Storable to something less idiotic

0.06
    - Use epoch, not ISO 8601 dates in JSPON map by default to avoid issues
      with DateTime::Format::ISO8601 dependency in testing. Will support both in the future
    - Fix tied support for JSPON

0.05
    - Add default typemaps for JSON and Storable serialization

0.04
    - Fix ->clear in KiokuDB::GIN
